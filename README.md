## Meet Elixa
Elixa Newpal is a beginning software engineering student with a passion for helping her fellow bootcampers debug their code.  While she doesn't have much hands-on technical experience, she has picked up some programming tips, especially when it comes to common rookie mistakes in Ruby, Rails or Java.  Even if her suggestions are not exactly on point, sometimes just chatting through troubleshooting woes can help.  Elixa figures she as least as good of a troubleshooting partner as a rubber duck.  And when a bug has you really stuck, what have you got to lose?

Elixa's friendly attitude, familiar Slack-like interface, and constant availability makes her an appealing option for anyone who needs to chat through a thorny coding problem.  Her technical tips are based on the learning experiences of many software bootcamp students and instructors. Elixa's advice includes targeted responses at the mention of specific technologies, as well as general programming wisdom.  And if the conversation strays off the topic of programming, she may slip into interactions based on her previous career as a psychotherapist!
